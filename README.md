# athena-platformer


Project by:
Michelle Luu and Anya Schenck

For our Parthenon project, we made a 2D platformer game called Athena Platformer. We used the theme of Parthenon in our project by incorporating design elements from the website and our assigned Greek goddesses (Ma’at and Minerva). The player is Athena, and at the end of each level, the player reaches a different Greek Goddess, which leads them to the next level. To complete each level, the player has to navigate through both stationary and moving platforms. 

The biggest challenge we faced while making our game was the process of collaborating on Godot. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out the setup for collaboration and ended up just both working on one computer. We both learned how to use Godot for the first time through this project!
